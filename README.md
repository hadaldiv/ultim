- me = pony is a cosplay of a character that i heavily identify with
- comf = pony is a cosplay of a character i find comfort in

basics . .


- refrain from copying my ponies ; slight inspiration is okay. don't screenshot for the purpose of copying or uploading to other sites like pinterest ;_;
- i am more often than not off tab and tend to be drawing on the people around me's strawpages when i am; my sign-off on drawings is usually -ultim. if you'd  like to talk to me, please whisper or i likely won't see it.
- anyone is more than welcome to interact & i encourage it, but be mindful that i am very anxious and have difficulty talking to new people. even so, i would love to make new friends, especially if we share interests (emphasis on sonic. even heavier emphasis on the murder of sonic the hedgehog & sonic prime). hmu!
- c+h is always okay and welcomed. i love sitting / cuddling with people, friends or not. i'm usually around the sonic area and/or sitting with my friends.
